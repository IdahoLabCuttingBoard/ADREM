Analytical Data Reduction Excel Macro (ADREM)

The excel macro package takes a input set of elemental and isotopic data from analytical analyses and manipulates it so 
that it can be summarized in a table. The manipulations include removal of unnecessary data points, unit conversion, 
standardization, and summation into a Microsoft excel spreadsheet.
